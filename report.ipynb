    "In this digitalized world today, laptops are one of the most demanding digital products. According to Grand View Research, the global laptop market was valued at $194.25 billion in 2022 and is expected to grow in the foreseeable future (Afzal, 2023). This market amount is created by laptops that vary in price on a significant range from less than two hundred to a few thousand dollars. However, the prices of laptops are surely not unpredictable. Here in this project, we answer the question: how can we predict the laptop market price by the appropriate determinants?\n",
    "\n",
    "This question is important because it helps customers to understand the factors behind the pricing of laptops which helps them to make reasonable decisions while choosing a laptop. Also, the result of this research benefits laptop producers and sellers in price-making strategies. This research lets laptop producers have a better picture of laptops with what types of features should be priced higher on the market. We try to approach this question by fitting a KNN regression model on the dataset “laptop 2024” (Kumar, 2024). The dataset that our research is based on is a public dataset on Kaggle uploaded by Aniket Kumar. It collects data from 991 unique laptops with 22 features. All information is updated to January 14, 2024."

    "1. Strategic pricing: Given the basic information of a laptop, we could suggest pricing using our model. Companies can price their products competitively and maximize their profit margins.\n",
    "2. Product Design and development: Insights from our predictive model can guide product design by highlighting which features contribute most significantly to perceived value and price. It could help companies make design decisions on their future products.\n",
    "3. Consumer Decision-making: Help consumers make decisions based on our results. It can empower them to make more informed decisions, balancing their budget with their need and preferences.\n",
    "4. Market Trend: Industry observers can use our findings to identify trends in the laptop market. Given the findings of this research, the impact exists in many aspects. Firstly, by the model provided by this research, the price of a laptop can be predicted by some basic information about it. This can be helpful to customers as they can better about understand how much the laptop they intended to buy is actually worth and therefore make the best decision. Laptop companies as well can use this information while they are setting prices for their laptop products to maximize the market. Besides that, Insights from our predictive model can guide product design by highlighting which features contribute most significantly to perceived value and price. It could help laptop companies make design decisions in the future to design more profitable products."

    "2. Region Market Difference: We could explore feature importance differences in regions. Exploring this could uncover opportunities for localized marketing strategies or product customization to meet regional demands.\n",
    "3. Impact of brand reputation: Explore the question: \"How does a brand's reputation or perceived quality affect laptop prices?\" Further research could quantify the brand effect and its interaction with product features in price setting.\n",
    "4. Different models: We only tried KNN model here, we could try more advanced predictive models in machine learning algorithms in the future to increase our accuracy and overall performance."
