    "In this digitalized world today, laptops are one of the most demanding digital products. According to Grand View Research, the global laptop market was valued at $194.25 billion in 2022 and is expected to grow in the foreseeable future (Afzal, 2023). This market amount is created by laptops that vary in price on a significant range from less than two hundred to a few thousand dollars. However, the prices of laptops are surely not unpredictable. Here in this project, we answer the question: how can we predict the laptop market price by the appropriate determinants?\n",
    "\n",
    "This question is important because it helps customers to understand the factors behind the pricing of laptops which helps them to make reasonable decisions while choosing a laptop. Also, the result of this research benefits laptop producers and sellers in price-making strategies. This research lets laptop producers have a better picture of laptops with what types of features should be priced higher on the market. We try to approach this question by fitting a KNN regression model on the dataset “laptop 2024” (Kumar, 2024). The dataset that our research is based on is a public dataset on Kaggle uploaded by Aniket Kumar. It collects data from 991 unique laptops with 22 features. All information is updated to January 14, 2024."

    "### Research Project Methodology: Predicting Laptop Prices through Feature Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "The aim of this project is to develop a predictive model that can estimate the price of laptops based on various product features. Accurate estimation of the price is crucial for all laptop users, both for the professionals and amators, that are planning to buy new laptops, as well as for the sellers and the laptop mrket industry, as it helps identify potential importance of each of the feature and determine appropriate buying strategies. This model aims to serve various stakeholders in the laptop market, including potential buyers seeking to make informed purchasing decisions, sellers aiming to strategize their pricing, and industry analysts interested in understanding the impact of different laptop features on their market value. The research specifically seeks to identify the determinants of laptop prices, providing insights into which attributes significantly influence cost in the competitive laptop market.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset provided for this project consists of a large number of observations from both a training sample and a test sample. Each observation includes information such as the laptop's brand, model, price, rating, processor details, number of cores and threads, ram memory, primary storage type, capcity and many others. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Dataset Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The core of this research is based on a meticulously curated dataset titled [\"Laptop Dataset (2024)\"]((https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aniket1505/laptop-dataset-2023?resource=download)) downloaded from Kaggle which encompasses a rich collection of 991 unique laptop entries extracted from the Smartprix website. This dataset has been carefully cleaned and updated as of January 14, 2024, ensuring its reliability for in-depth analysis. It features 22 distinct attributes for each laptop, including but not limited to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Brand and Model**: Identifying the manufacturer and specific model of the laptop.\n",
    "- **Price**: Listed in Indian Rupees, providing a direct measure of market value.\n",
    "- **Processor Specifications**: Including brand, tier, number of cores, and threads.\n",
    "- **Memory and Storage**: Details on RAM, primary and secondary storage types and capacities.\n",
    "- **GPU Details**: Information on the brand and type of graphics processing unit.\n",
    "- **Display Characteristics**: Screen size, resolution, and touch screen functionality.\n",
    "- **Operating System**: The installed OS.\n",
    "- **Warranty**: The duration of the manufacturer's warranty.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "To achieve the project's goal, the methodology will encompass several key stages:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Initial steps of data preprocessing will include cleaning the data for inconsistencies, handling missing values, and encoding categorical variables to prepare the dataset for modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The stage of explanatory data analysis (EDA) involves examining the dataset to understand the distribution of key features, identify outliers, and uncover potential relationships between variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Based on insights from EDA, new features may be engineered to better capture the influence of certain attributes on laptop prices. This could include interaction terms or derived features like performance-to-price ratios.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. A variety of machine learning models, including linear regression, decision trees, and ensemble methods like random forest and gradient boosting, will be evaluated to determine the most effective approach for price prediction. Model selection will be based on cross-validation performance metrics such as R-squared and mean squared error (MSE).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. The selected model will be rigorously tested using a hold-out test sample to assess its generalization ability and accuracy in predicting laptop prices. \n",
    "\n",
    "6. Once the model is finalized, an analysis of feature importance will be conducted to identify which laptop characteristics are most predictive of price. This will address the research question by highlighting the key determinants of laptop pricing.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Expected Outcomes\n",
    "\n",
    "The culmination of this research project is anticipated to yield a robust model that can predict laptop prices with high accuracy, offering valuable insights into the factors that most significantly impact laptop market values. Through this analysis, stakeholders in the laptop industry will be better equipped to understand pricing dynamics, facilitating more informed decision-making processes for both consumers and sellers. Additionally, the project aims to contribute to the academic and practical understanding of price determination in technology markets, potentially guiding future research and development strategies within the laptop industry."
