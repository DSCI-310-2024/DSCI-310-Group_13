    "Our project aims to answer the question \"How can we predict determinants of the laptop market price?\". We used publically available Kaggle dataset \"Laptop Dataset (2024)\". We performed a robust data analysis in Python, spanning from importing data to sharing insights, prioritizing the creation of workflows that are both replicable and reliable. We used classification machine learning method to construct our predictive model. Our results are that the price can be predicted by determinaning its (...)."
