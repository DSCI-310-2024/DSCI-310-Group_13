    "Our project aims to answer the question \"How can we predict determinants of the laptop market price?\". We used publically available Kaggle dataset \"Laptop Dataset (2024)\". We performed a robust data analysis in Python, spanning from importing data to sharing insights, prioritizing the creation of workflows that are both replicable and reliable. We used classification machine learning method to construct our predictive model. Our results are that the price can be predicted by determinaning its (...)."

    "In this digitalized world today, laptops are one of the most demanding digital products. According to Grand View Research, the global laptop market was valued at $194.25 billion in 2022 and is expected to grow in the foreseeable future (Afzal, 2023). This market amount is created by laptops that vary in price on a significant range from less than two hundred to a few thousand dollars. However, the prices of laptops are surely not unpredictable. Here in this project, we answer the question: how can we predict the laptop market price by the appropriate determinants? \n",
    "\n",
    "This question is important because it helps customers to understand the factors behind the pricing of laptops which helps them to make reasonable decisions while choosing a laptop. Therefore, avoid paying extra or missing a deal. Also, the result of this research benefits laptop producers and sellers in price-making strategies. We try to approach this question by fitting a regression model on the dataset “laptop 2024” (Kumar, 2024). The dataset we are using is  \n"
