# Introduction

In this digitalized world today, laptops are one of the most demanding digital products. According to Grand View Research, the global laptop market was valued at $194.25 billion in 2022 and is expected to grow in the foreseeable future (Afzal, 2023). This market amount is created by laptops that vary in price on a significant range from less than two hundred to a few thousand dollars. However, the prices of laptops are surely not unpredictable. Here in this project, we answer the question: how can we predict the laptop market price by the appropriate determinants?

This question is important because it helps customers to understand the factors behind the pricing of laptops which helps them to make reasonable decisions while choosing a laptop. Also, the result of this research benefits laptop producers and sellers in price-making strategies. This research lets laptop producers have a better picture of laptops with what types of features should be priced higher on the market. We try to approach this question by fitting a KNN regression model on the dataset “laptop 2024” (Kumar, 2024). The dataset that our research is based on is a public dataset on Kaggle uploaded by Aniket Kumar. It collects data from 991 unique laptops with 22 features. All information is updated to January 14, 2024.

![Distribution of laptop prices](visualisations/Graph1.png){#fig-graph1 width=90%}

The key takeaway from analyzing the distribution of laptop prices from @fig-graph1 is that there is a clear skew towards lower-priced models. The majority of laptops are clustered in the lower price range, with a significant drop in frequency as prices increase. This suggests that more affordable laptops are far more common, or at least more commonly listed on the Smartprix website from which this data was sourced.

The prevalence of lower-priced laptops could indicate a stronger market demand in this price segment, possibly reflecting the purchasing power of the consumer base or the competitive pricing strategies of manufacturers. For predictive modeling, this skewness towards lower prices could influence the model's accuracy, potentially leading it to be more reliable at predicting prices for lower-priced laptops than for higher-priced ones.

Additionally, the tapering off of frequency at higher price points may point to a smaller niche market for premium laptops. For businesses and retailers, this distribution could inform inventory and marketing strategies, emphasizing the broad appeal of budget-friendly options. In the context of price prediction, care must be taken to ensure that the model does not undervalue the unique features and qualities that might justify the higher prices of less common, premium models.
