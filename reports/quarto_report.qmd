# Summary

Our project aims to answer the question "How can we predict determinants of the laptop market price?". We used publically available [Laptop Dataset(2024)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aniket1505/laptop-dataset-2023). 
We performed a robust data analysis in Python, spanning from importing data to sharing insights, prioritizing the creation of workflows that are both replicable and reliable. 
We used the Linear regression method to construct our predictive model. 
Our results are that the price can be predicted by building a and training a model using variables such present in the data such as: Rating, num_cores, num_threads, ram_memory, primary_storage_capacity, secondary_storage_capacity, is_touch_screen, display_size, resolution_width and resolution_height.
