# Contributing to our project

## Welcome!

We're thrilled you're considering contributing to our project. Your support is essential for making it better. This document outlines how you can contribute effectively.

## How to Contribute

### Environment Setup

1. Begin by forking the project repository on GitHub. Refer to the [GitHub Documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo) for guidance on forking a repository. `git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/Laptops--market-prices-detemrinants-prediction.git`.

  2. Stay in sync with the original repository by [syncing your fork](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/syncing-a-fork).
 
  3. Set up your local environment and install all necessary dependencies: `cd project-name/
python -m`, `pip install -e .[dev]`. The `[dev]` suffix ensures you also install development dependencies listed in `environment.yml`.

### Making Changes
1. Always work on a new branch for your changes: `git switch -c feature-branch-name`.
2. Make your modifications, adhering to the project's coding standards. If the project includes generated code or schemas, ensure they're updated accordingly.
3. Run the project's test suite to verify your changes don't introduce errors: `pytest`.
4. Ensure all tests pass and, if possible, add new tests to cover your changes.

### Submitting Your Contribution
1. Stage and commit your changes: `git add modified-file.py`, `git commit -m "A descriptive message about your changes"`.
2. Upload your branch to GitHub: `git push origin feature-branch-name`.
3. Go to the GitHub page of your fork and open a pull request to the main project. Follow the [GitHub guide to creating a pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request).
4. Wait for feedback on your PR from project maintainers. Be open to suggestions and make any requested adjustments to your code.
